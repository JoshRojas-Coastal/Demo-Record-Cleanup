			</div>
			<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				You know how demos often get cluttered with artifacts from previous demo or test runs? Records are created and never
				get cleaned up, leaving you wondering long afterwards whether or not they are necessary for the demo scenarios or if
				they can be cleared away. This component allows you to clean up the org between demos so that any future demo can be
				started with a clean environment, deleting any records that were created by previous demos, dry runs, or tests, and
				optionally executing any custom code or flows to reset the state of the org to a pristine condition.
			</p>
			<h2 class="slds-var-p-top_large"><strong>How It Works</strong></h2>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				The component is driven by a series of Demo Cleanup Tasks which you create. These tasks fall into three categories:
			</p>
			<ul class="slds-list_dotted slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				<li>
					<strong>SOQL tasks</strong> delete records of an object that match an optional SOQL&nbsp;
					<span class="slds-text-font_monospace">WHERE</span> &nbsp;clause that you create. For example, golden records
					that have been hand-crafted for a demo scenario or those that have been uploaded in bulk for use in analytics
					dashboards might be tagged with custom checkbox fields to indicate that they are to be retained. Any other
					records of that object not so tagged would then be considered to be a by-product of a demo run and could be
					safely deleted.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Apex tasks</strong> run an Apex class that you specify. The class must implement the&nbsp;
					<span class="slds-text-font_monospace">DemoCleanupApexItem</span> &nbsp;interface. These can be useful for
					resetting demo parameters that do not involve deleting records, such as activating or deactivating users.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Flow tasks</strong> run an autolaunched flow that you specify. The component passes the Id of the task
					into the flow through the&nbsp; <span class="slds-text-font_monospace">DemoCleanupTaskId</span> &nbsp;input
					variable, so if the flow needs to access any of the fields in the cleanup task, you should define that variable
					in the RESOURCES section of the flow.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				To set up a SOQL cleanup task, just navigate to the&nbsp;
				<lightning-formatted-url value={cleanupTaskListViewUrl} label="Demo Cleanup Tasks tab" target="_parent">
				</lightning-formatted-url>
				&nbsp;and create as many tasks as you need (although no more than 90 SOQL tasks can be active at any given time).
				Each one will require a description, which will appear in the task list, the API name of the object whose records
				you want to delete, and a&nbsp;
				<lightning-formatted-url
					label="SOQL WHERE clause expression"
					value="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_conditionexpression.htm"
					target="_parent"
				></lightning-formatted-url>
				&nbsp;to specify which records of that object should be deleted. Additionally, you can specify whether or not the
				records bypass the&nbsp;
				<lightning-formatted-url
					label="recycle bin"
					value="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=recycle_bin.htm&amp;type=5"
				></lightning-formatted-url>
				, resulting in a permanent deletion. Finally, you can choose to activate or deactivate the task to specify whether
				or not it appears in the list of available tasks in the component.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Power users wishing to create Apex tasks can choose the Apex cleanup task record type and fill in the name of an
				Apex class. The Apex class must implement the&nbsp;
				<span class="slds-text-font_monospace">DemoCleanupApexItem</span> &nbsp; interface.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Those users who wish to invoke flows may choose the Flow cleanup task record type and fill in the API name of the
				flow to execute.
			</p>
			<h2 class="slds-var-p-top_large"><strong>Guardrails</strong></h2>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Several precautions are taken to ensure that only the records you want to delete are deleted.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				First, the [New] and [Edit] actions on the Demo Cleanup Tasks list view will not create or update a task without
				first validating its correctness.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Second, the component populates the <strong>Records</strong> column in the component by running a test query using
				the object API name and SOQL&nbsp; <span class="slds-text-font_monospace">WHERE</span> &nbsp;clause expression you
				supplied for each SOQL Demo Cleanup Task. If any are in error, the component will display an error message and
				disable the checkbox for that task. You should always check the record counts for each of the Demo Cleanup Tasks to
				make sure that a suspiciously large number of records is not being deleted.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Third, all SOQL Demo Cleanup Tasks are checked to make sure that no two tasks try to clean up the same object, since
				one task will clobber records considered safe by the second and vice versa. Any subsequent Demo Cleanup Tasks using
				the same object will not be executed and their checkboxes will not be selectable. The way to fix this is to combine
				the duplicate tasks into a single record and use an appropriate
				<span class="slds-text-font_monospace">WHERE</span> &nbsp;clause that covers the combined conditions. You can also
				deselect the checkbox called "Check for Reused Objects" in the component's configuration section in Lightning App
				Builder.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Fourth, each SOQL Demo Cleanup Task has a&nbsp;
				<lightning-icon icon-name="utility:preview" size="x-small"></lightning-icon>
				&nbsp;icon which can be clicked to reveal the list of records that will be deleted by that task.
			</p>
			<p class="slds-var-p-top_small slds-hyphenate">
				Finally, a modal dialog will pop up when you click the <strong>Clean Up the Demo</strong> button, confirming the
				actions that will be taken and giving you one last chance to reconsider.
			</p>
